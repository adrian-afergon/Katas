# Katas

At this project we will add multiple *Katas* where store different solutions for them.
The idea is create a catalog where we can compare the evolution at different technologies,
see different approaches used at different time, or just have fun reminding good moments making
pair with friends

## Structure

This project will contain multiple projects inside, independent between of them, so we will have at the root path
the different *Katas*, and inside them each independent project with different solutions

```markdown
/root
    |
    |- kata1
    |   |-solution1    
    |   |-solution2    
    |   |-solution3    
    |- kata2
    |   |-solution1    
    |   |-solution2
    |- kata3
```

Each Kata should contain their own README.md explaining the statement of the exercise.
